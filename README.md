# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Kadeem

Hi, I'm Kadeem â€” a motivated, self-taught Python developer transitioning from marketing and design into the backend development world, where it finally feels like home.

Iâ€™ve built AI-powered tools, automation scripts, and daily content apps by combining curiosity, real-world experience, and online learning. My background in creative problem-solving helps me bring a fresh perspective to backend systems and automation.

Every day, I'm focused on learning more about Python, backend systems, and automation â€” and applying it to real-world problems.
